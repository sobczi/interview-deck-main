# Task
The task is to create a simple card game using https://deckofcardsapi.com API.

## Rules:

1. Each game starts with all cards shuffled and displayed as a grid
2. Each card has its weight where the 2 is the smallest and ace is the highest (color is irrelevant)
3. Players take turns revealing cards
4. Each player can reveal only one card in their turn
5. Weight of the revealed card is added to player's score
6. Game ends when all cards are revealed
7. Player with the highest score wins

## Extras:

As a user I want to:
1. see a counter to know how many cards are left
2. be able to start a new game without refreshing the page
3. see which card was revealed by which player
4. be able to track my score during the match
5. see the clearly indicated result of the match
